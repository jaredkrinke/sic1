Greetings, {{self.name}}.

I wanted to share with you a little side project I've been working on. I'm calling it "Sandbox Mode". Basically, it's a special SIC-1 Emulator mode that allows you to specify your own input.

This is useful when you just want to play around with the SIC-1 to see how things work. You can experiment with this to test out new techniques without worrying about output getting flagged as incorrect.

Sandbox Mode should be visible up in your Program Inventory under the "Diversions" group.

Let me know what you think!
