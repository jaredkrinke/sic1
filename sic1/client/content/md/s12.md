Greetings, {{self.name}}.

Self-modifying code can be tricky to understand at first. For the "stack memory" example, I found that it's easiest to simply step through the program (using the "Step" button or "Ctrl+.") to see what it's doing.

Using this approach, you can see that the first bit of code is a loop that repeats as long as `@count` is greater than zero. Once the counter runs out, execution branches to the next chunk of code, and so on.

You can also watch the stack grow in the "Memory" table in the upper right. In the example, the stack happens to start at address 32 (defined by `@stack_address`), which is the beginning of the third row of the table. Note that numbers are shown in hexadecimal and two's complement is used for negative numbers (`80` in hex is -128 in decimal), so `ff` means -1, `fe` means -2, and so on.

Hope that helps!
