    "defaultMessage": "; The Single Instruction Computer Mark 1 (SIC-1) is an 8-bit computer with 256 bytes of memory. Programs for the SIC-1 are written in SIC-1 Assembly Language.\n;\n; Each instruction is 3 bytes, specified as follows:\n;\n;   subleq A B [C]\n;\n; A, B, and C are memory addresses (0 - 255) or labels.\n;\n; \"subleq\" subtracts the value at address B from the value at address A and stores the result at address A (i.e. mem[A] ← mem[A] - mem[B]).\n;\n; If the result is <= 0, execution branches to address C.\n;\n; Note that if C is not specified, the address of the next instruction is automatically added by the assembler (in effect, this means that taking the branch is no different from advancing to the next instruction).\n;\n; For convenience, addresses can be specified using labels. The following predefined labels are always available:\n;\n;   @MAX (252): Maximum user-modifiable address\n;   @IN (253): Reads a value from input (writes are ignored)\n;   @OUT (254): Writes a result to output (reads as zero)\n;   @HALT (255): Terminates the program when accessed\n;\n; Note: any text following a semicolon is considered a comment. Comments are ignored by the assembler.\n; \n; Below is a very simple SIC-1 program that negates one input value and writes it out.\n;\n; E.g. if the input value from @IN is 3, it subtracts 3 from @OUT (which reads as zero), and the result of 0 - 3 = -3 is written out.\n\nsubleq @OUT, @IN\n\n; Use the \"Compile/Step\" (Ctrl+.) and \"Run\" (Ctrl+Enter) buttons to execute the program until all expected outputs have been successfully written out (see the \"In\"/\"Expected\"/\"Out\" table to the left).\n    ",
